# Releases

## Sorting Hat 0.2 - (2017-02-01)

** New features and improvements: **

 * Auto complete profile information with `autoprofile` command.

   This command autocompletes the profiles information related to a set of unique
   identities. To update the profile, the command uses a list of sources ordered
   by priority. Only those unique identities which have one or more identities
   from any of these sources will be updated. The name of the profile will be
   filled using the best name possible, normally the longest one.

 * GiHub identities matching method.

   This new method tries to find equal identities using those identities from
   GitHub sources. The identities must come from a source starting with a `github`
   label and the usernames must be equal.

** Bugs fixed: **

 * The parser for Gitdm files only accepted email addresses as valid aliases.
   This has been modified to accept any type of aliases. Thus, the input file
   passed to `gidm2sh` script will be a list of valid aliases instead of email
   aliases.
